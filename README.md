Welcome to my repo-in-progress of Moroccan Arabic that I collected in the Fall of 2013 for my dissertation! I now have a fulltime, non-academic job, so this side project may change slowly. 

I am starting by adding the texts of written Moroccan Arabic in order to get something out there more quickly. My participants all agreed to allow their writing and spoken conversations to be shared publicly, with the condition of any names being removed. This is immensely kind on their part, as this type of corpus tends to remain completely closed for a variety of reasons. If you would like to speed along the process for the spoken recordings, and speak Moroccan, and know how to edit sound files to remove names, please contact me as I would be happy to share this work in order to make more content publicly available more quickly.

## Written chats
The written chats were all completed by participants over Facebook which, at the time, was the most popular chat platform among Moroccans in this age range. All chats were an hour long and were completed without the researcher (a non-Moroccan, native speaker of American English) present. See my dissertation for more details.

## The book I wrote
If you would like to read about 250 pages on this topic, it is openly available [from the UT libraries](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/31440/POST-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf)
